# Module 4 Challenge - School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
Due to academic dishonesty found amongst the ninth graders at Thomas High School, we were tasked with removing that particular data from the analysis and recalculate everything.

## Results

#### School and District Summary

 - From the images provided in the challenge module, we can see the affect of the changes immediately. Thomas High School scores improved dramatically as soon as we removed the scores of the 9th graders. 

#### School Performance
![Top 5 Rankings](/Resources/top5_rankings.png)

- Immediate improvements to the overall scores of Thomas High School after removing the 9th grade tests, skyrocketing from the bottom 5 to #2 on the list. 

#### Scores by Grade
 - 9th graders scores increased

#### Scores by School Spending/Size/Type
 - The category that Thomas High School is associated with increased in all these counts.
 - These 9th graders sucked

## Summary
Overall, the changes were that in whichever categories the 9th graders at Thomas High School were associated with, the performance of that category improved dramatically. 
 - This doesn't bode well for the 9th graders as even with the academic dishonesty which typically improves grades, their scores were dragging down the rest of the school's scores significantly.
